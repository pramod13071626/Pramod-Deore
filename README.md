Greetings! I'm Pramod M. Deore.

My journey is anchored in a great curiosity that leads me in the understanding and analysis of data to support decision making. I have also cultivated variety of tools and technologies knowledge such as Power BI, Advanced Excel, Google Sheets, SQL Python among others. My passion is in data analysis and applied in various fields in order to change the world.

Even though my previous work experience has been mostly clerical for the last 2 years, I learned to become more organized and solve problems and these skills are valuable in handling data. In my clerical position, I witnessed a number of functions which involved organizing data and writing reports hence through managerial report I would like to take my chance at the field of data analysis.
The focus within my academic tenure is given more towards fine-tuning skills in computer science and data analysis. I have gone through with the capabilities of the machine learning and found out how to analyze data and even how to display it in the best way possible. In reality, my ambition is to professionally get a job in the data and analytics field with my abilities to support the decision making of companies and institutions to make appropriate decisions based on available information.

I have high interest in the opportunity to join an active team and make value propositions based on data analysis while constantly expanding my knowledge. I am eager to share my experience with other professionals in the data science discipline and discover how we might derive very useful information from huge quantities of raw data.

Don’t hesitate to contact us and let’s discover how much potential data has!
